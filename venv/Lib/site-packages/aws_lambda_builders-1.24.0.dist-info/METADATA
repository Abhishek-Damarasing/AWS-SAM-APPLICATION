Lambda Builders is a Python library to compile, build and package AWS Lambda functions for several runtimes & 
frameworks.

Lambda Builders currently contains the following workflows

* Java with Gradle
* Java with Maven
* Dotnet with amazon.lambda.tools
* Python with Pip
* Javascript with Npm
* Typescript with esbuild
* Ruby with Bundler
* Go with Mod

In Addition to above workflows, AWS Lambda Builders also supports *Custom Workflows* through a Makefile.

Lambda Builders is the brains behind the `sam build` command from [AWS SAM CLI](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-cli)

### Integrating with Lambda Builders

Lambda Builders is a Python library.
It additionally exposes a JSON-RPC 2.0 interface to use from other languages.

If you intend to integrate with Lambda Builders,
check out [this section of the DESIGN DOCUMENT](DESIGN.md#builders-library).
